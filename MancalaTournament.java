 * Tournament.java - Simple Mancala tournament software
 * See the TODO comments below.  This software assumes that all player class files are located in the same directory and have a unique player ID as a prefix
 * to "MancalaPlayer.java".  List these unique player IDs in the String[] playerIdentifiers.
 * The software will create detailed player logs of games in a "log/" subdirectory, naming files according to the 0-based index of 
 * player numbers in playerIdentifiers.
 * A MancalaTournamentResults.csv file will be generated summarizing tournament results.
 * While running, the console will report high-level progress in the round-robin tournament.
 * If a round-robin tournament is not desired (e.g. too many players), please develop alternative tournament code and share it!
